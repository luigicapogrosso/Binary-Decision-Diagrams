# Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) #

This GitHub repository will contain a set of slides that explain Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a data structure widely used in designing and verifying digital systems.
Over the years, BDDs have become popular because they provide a good balance between being easy to understand and efficient for working with logical expressions.
These slides are designed for both beginners and experienced and:
- Introduce the basics of BDDs (or DDs in general) to get a quick start.
- Cover advanced topics like making BDDs smaller and creating efficient tools to work with them.
- Discuss new ways BDDs are being used beyond their traditional applications.

<p align="center"> ðŸš§ The slides will be released soon. Stay tuned! ðŸš§ </p>
