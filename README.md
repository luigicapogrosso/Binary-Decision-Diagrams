# Binary Decision Diagrams #

This GitHub repository will contain a set of slides that explain Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a data structure widely used in designing and verifying digital systems.
Over the years, BDDs have become popular because they provide a good balance between being easy to understand and efficient for working with logical expressions.
These slides are designed for both beginners and experienced users:
- They introduce the basics of BDDs (or DDs in general) to get a quick start.
- They cover advanced topics like making BDDs smaller and creating efficient tools to work with them.
- They also discuss new ways BDDs are being used beyond their traditional applications.
